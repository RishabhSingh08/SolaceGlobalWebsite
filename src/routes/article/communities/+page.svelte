      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Wars not only destroy landscapes and economies but also dismantle lives, communities, and futures. As of 2022, over 89.3 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced by conflicts, according to the UNHCR. This stark reality underscores the need for innovative and compassionate responses that harness the power of technology, critical thinking, and collaborative efforts. By integrating the principles of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) into its mission, Solace Global is making strides in addressing global challenges, empowering individuals, and fostering innovative solutions for war-affected communities.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800">The Multi-Faceted Impact of War</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">Conflicts disrupt the fabric of society, leaving behind physical and emotional scars. For example:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>The Syrian Civil War displaced over 14 million people and destroyed essential infrastructure.</li>
          <li>The war in Ukraine left 17.6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance by 2023, many of whom struggle with access to clean water, food, and healthcare.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These crises particularly affect underserved communities, limiting access to education, stalling technological progress, and exacerbating systemic inequalities. STEM plays a pivotal role in bridging these gaps by developing innovative tools and solutions to rebuild communities, foster resilience, and drive recovery efforts.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800">The Role of Donations in STEM-Driven Relief</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Donations play an integral role in translating STEM innovations into impactful solutions. For example:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>A $25 contribution can provide a solar-powered lamp for a child’s education in areas without electricity.</li>
          <li>A $100 donation can fund mobile STEM workshops, equipping displaced youth with skills to rebuild their communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        By supporting Solace Global, donors empower underserved populations with the knowledge and tools to overcome challenges and foster creativity.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800">A STEM-Driven Success Story</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        One remarkable example of STEM in action is the rehabilitation of a war-torn village in Yemen. With Solace Global’s support, engineers constructed a clean water system powered by solar panels, benefiting 5,000 residents. Simultaneously, digital learning hubs were introduced, enabling local children to explore science and engineering concepts despite the surrounding chaos.
