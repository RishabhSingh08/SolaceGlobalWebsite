    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800">The Human Cost of War</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
    War devastates civilian populations in multiple ways:
    </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Over 14 million Syrians have fled their homes since 2011, while ongoing conflicts in Yemen have displaced 4.5 million people.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Insecurity:</strong> The World Food Programme reports that 70% of Yemen's population—over 21 million people—require food assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Crises:</strong> Conflict zones often face collapsed healthcare systems. For example, only half of Ukraine’s hospitals were fully operational by mid-2023 due to targeted attacks and infrastructure damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The long-term impacts extend beyond physical survival, affecting mental health, education, and economic opportunities. Neutral humanitarian assistance ensures that aid reaches these communities without discrimination or political interference.
