      <h2 class="text-3xl text-left font-semibold text-gray-800">Disease Surveillance Systems: Real-Time Outbreak Tracking</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        In areas where healthcare infrastructure is lacking, tracking disease outbreaks in real time is crucial. AI-powered disease surveillance systems analyze data from hospitals, clinics, and public health reports to identify patterns indicating emerging outbreaks. For example, AI can detect early signs of diseases like malaria and Ebola, enabling faster responses such as deploying medical teams or distributing vaccines. By providing early warnings, these systems help control outbreaks before they escalate, saving lives and reducing the spread of diseases.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-left text-gray-800">Engineering Infrastructure for Healthcare: Mobile Clinics and Isolation Centers</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Mobile clinics and isolation centers are another key STEM solution, providing healthcare in areas without adequate facilities. Mobile units, equipped with essential medical technology, offer services like routine checkups, vaccinations, and treatment for common diseases such as malaria. Isolation centers are vital for treating contagious diseases like COVID-19, containing outbreaks, and ensuring patient safety. These mobile and adaptable healthcare solutions ensure that even the most remote communities can access critical care.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-left text-gray-800">Technological Innovations: Portable Diagnostic Tools and Telemedicine</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Portable diagnostic tools and telemedicine are revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered in underserved regions. Devices like the mChip allow healthcare workers to test for diseases like malaria and HIV on-site, reducing the need for expensive labs. Telemedicine platforms connect local healthcare providers with specialists, offering consultations and treatment advice remotely. These innovations make healthcare more accessible, enabling faster diagnoses and treatments in areas where medical expertise is limited.

    <!-- Community Education: STEM-Based Hygiene and Vaccination Campaigns -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-left text-gray-800">Community Education: STEM-Based Hygiene and Vaccination Campaigns</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Community education is essential in preventing the spread of diseases. STEM-based hygiene campaigns teach communities about handwashing, sanitation, and safe drinking water. Vaccination campaigns also raise awareness about the importance of immunization, helping to prevent diseases like polio and measles. By empowering communities with knowledge about disease prevention, these campaigns reduce health risks and improve public health.
