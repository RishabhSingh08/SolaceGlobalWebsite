      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        When I walked into my first day of high school, I felt like I had entered an entirely different world—one where everyone seemed to be competing in an unspoken race for perfection. My name is Adhi, and today, I'm a college graduate with a degree in computational engineering, working in a top 10 consulting company. But getting here wasn’t easy. Looking back at my hyper-competitive high school experience, I’m grateful for the lessons it taught me, though it wasn’t without its share of struggles.

    <!-- High School Pressure -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">The Pressure of High School</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        I attended a high school known for its rigorous academics and cutthroat environment. From the moment I stepped onto campus, I felt the pressure to excel. Conversations revolved around AP classes, perfect GPAs, prestigious summer programs, and college acceptance rates. Social media only amplified the stress, as everyone seemed to broadcast their achievements for the world to see. At first, I tried to keep up, signing up for every advanced class, joining clubs I wasn’t passionate about, and spending late nights poring over homework. But as the workload grew, so did my feelings of self-doubt. No matter how hard I tried, I always felt like I was falling short.

    <!-- Turning Point -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">A Life-Changing Realization</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        The turning point came during my sophomore year, after I bombed a major math exam. It wasn’t just the bad grade that hit me—it was the realization that I was pushing myself to meet someone else’s definition of success. I couldn’t keep running on this treadmill of comparison. For the first time, I asked myself: What do I actually enjoy?

    <!-- Finding Passion -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Discovering My Passion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Slowly, I began shifting my focus. I had always loved technology but had ignored it in favor of more “impressive” activities like debate club. I decided to join the school’s coding club and started working on small projects at home. Coding didn’t feel like work; it felt like solving puzzles, and I genuinely looked forward to it. My grades improved as I stopped trying to do everything and concentrated on what I cared about. I dropped a few extracurriculars and started going to therapy, where I learned strategies to manage anxiety and perfectionism. For the first time, I felt like I was in control.

    <!-- Overcoming Challenges -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Balancing Academics and Well-Being</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Balancing academics and personal interests wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. I still studied hard, but I also gave myself permission to relax, hang out with friends, and binge-watch my favorite shows without guilt. My parents, initially worried about my decision to drop some advanced classes, saw how much happier I was and became my biggest cheerleaders. My coding teacher became a mentor, encouraging me to apply for hackathons and internships. These supportive people helped me navigate the pressures I faced.

    <!-- Lessons Learned -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        The biggest lesson I learned was to stop comparing myself to others. It’s a hard habit to break, especially in a high-achieving environment, but I realized that everyone’s path is different. By focusing on what made me happy, I found success on my own terms. When I applied to college, my application highlighted my coding projects and internships—things I genuinely enjoyed—and I was accepted into my top choice. Today, my passion for technology has opened doors I never imagined, including my current internship, where I’m gaining real-world experience while still in school.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        To anyone feeling crushed by high school’s competitive pressures, my advice is this: focus on what excites you. You don’t have to follow someone else’s timeline or definition of success. Surround yourself with supportive people, take care of your mental health, and trust that your unique path will lead you where you need to go. The journey isn’t always easy, but it’s worth it—and so are you.
