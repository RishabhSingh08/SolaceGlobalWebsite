    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      When I walked into my first day of high school, I felt like I had entered an entirely different world—one where everyone seemed to be competing in an unspoken race for perfection. My name is Adhi, and today, I'm a college graduate with a degree in computational engineering, working in a top 10 consulting company. But getting here wasn't easy. My journey through high school taught me valuable lessons about focus, balance, and resilience, many of which I owe to a surprising source: running.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">The High School Environment</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      I attended a high school known for its rigorous academics and cutthroat environment. Conversations revolved around AP classes, perfect GPAs, prestigious summer programs, and college acceptance rates. Social media only amplified the stress, as everyone seemed to broadcast their achievements for the world to see. At first, I tried to keep up, signing up for every advanced class, joining multiple clubs, and spending late nights poring over homework. It was overwhelming, but I discovered a way to ground myself: running.

  <!-- Discovering Running -->
  <article>
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Finding My Anchor in Running</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      I joined the school's cross-country team during my freshman year, initially just to stay active. But it quickly became more than just exercise. Running gave me a structured way to clear my mind and focus on the present. Each practice and race required discipline, time management, and mental toughness—skills that carried over into my academics. It wasn't about competing with others; it was about challenging myself and improving with every step. That mindset became my anchor in an otherwise chaotic environment.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      Balancing running with academics and other interests taught me the value of prioritization. I learned how to manage my time effectively, fitting in training sessions while staying on top of schoolwork. Running also gave me a sense of accomplishment that wasn't tied to grades or external validation. Every mile I ran was a reminder of my own growth and perseverance, independent of anyone else's achievements.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      Being part of the cross-country team also helped me connect with a supportive group of peers. We shared early morning runs, post-race celebrations, and the camaraderie that comes from working toward a common goal. These friendships reminded me that success isn't just about individual accomplishments but about building meaningful relationships along the way. My coach, who emphasized effort over results, became a mentor, teaching me the importance of consistency and resilience.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Beyond High School</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      The life skills I gained through running set me apart when it came time to apply for college. My application highlighted not just my academic achievements but also my dedication to cross-country and the lessons I learned from it. I wrote about how running taught me to set goals, adapt to challenges, and find joy in the process rather than the outcome. These qualities resonated with admissions committees, and I was accepted into my top-choice college.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-left">Finding Your Ground</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
      To anyone feeling overwhelmed by high school's pressures, my advice is this: find something that grounds you. Whether it's a sport, a hobby, or another passion, invest in something that brings you clarity and balance. For me, running was more than just a sport; it was a teacher, a motivator, and a reminder that success is about growth, not comparison. Your unique path will lead you where you need to go, one step at a time.
