      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Africa has long been a hotspot for conflicts rooted in history, politics, and economics. From the Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon to the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the insurgencies in Mozambique and Nigeria, the continent faces devastating humanitarian consequences. These include mass displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of lives. Despite ongoing efforts, sustainable resolutions remain elusive.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-2">
              Central and South America also face significant conflicts, such as Mexicoâ€™s enduring drug war. This violence disrupts communities, fuels corruption, and undermines governance. Its humanitarian toll includes displacement, economic instability, and cross-border crime, necessitating comprehensive strategies for resolution and recovery.
